  <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

  <h4>27th January 2025</h4>

  <br />
<h2>Research Neuroplasticity:
</h2>
<br>

  <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
  </h2>
  <p>
    Understanding neuroplasticity, or the brain’s ability to change and adapt, can have a huge impact on your life. One improvement that usually has an instant correlation <b>is Better Learning and Skill Building</b>. When someone knows that the brain can form new connections, it makes it easier for them to learn something new. This immediately goes into <b>Rehabilitation after Injury</b>. For anyone that may be recovering from a brain injury, the idea is that the brain can rewire itself to gain any lost functions that have been lost. These are only a couple examples of the very positive impact directly caused by neuroplasticity. 

  </p>

  <br />

  <h2>
    Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
  </h2>
  <p>
    To engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit, I'd definitely want to master <b>Positive Habit Formation</b>. Being a 20 year old in this day and age, I’d say one of the toughest things to deal with is losing focus too quickly with all these media outlets everywhere you look. Forcing myself to try and have media breaks or just a digital detox in general, which always has me eventually caving back in and being in a never-ending loop. Understanding neuroplasticity means recognizing that I can change my habits, no matter how stuck I may think I am. 

  </p>

  <br />

  <h2>
    What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
  </h2>
  <p>
    To increase neuroplasticity, there are many approaches someone may take. Simple things like going for a walk or a run can promote the growth of new connections and boost brain health. One may even take a step further, challenging yourself into picking up a new skill, hobby or even language. Although there are many more techniques you can use, just by combining these two practices, you can create an environment that encourages continuous brain growth,

  <h2>Research Growth Mindset:</h2>
<br>
  <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
  <p>
    A <b>Growth Mindset</b> is a belief that your abilities can be further developed through effort and learning. The opposite to this is a fixed mindset, meaning that there is a belief that their abilities and talents are static traits which can’t be significantly changed. Here are a few examples of a <b>Growth Mindset</b>: </p>
<p><b>Encourages Learning & Resilience</b></p>
<p><b>Increases Performance & Motivation</b></p>
<p><b>Improves Relationships & Collaboration</b></p>
<p>It is quite obvious why having a Growth Mindset in comparison to a Fixed Mindset is better. The ability to look at the light at the end of the tunnel, will obviously come with many more positives.
  </p>

  <br />

  <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Quite a lot, researching this really opens your thoughts into what you are really telling yourself. Finding it quite a bad thing wondering if I have more of a growth or a fixed mindset.

  <h2>Blend with your Learning Plan and Strategies:

  </h2>
  
  <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.

  </h2>
  <p>
    In my learning plan I stated a couple of times saying that I believe one of my strengths is perseverance. Saying this, although I persevere, I quite often push myself too hard leaving me worn out and not taking a step-back to look at easier ways to tackle this challenge. This is where I believe strengthening my <b>Growth Mindset</b> would really help out.
