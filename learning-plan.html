  <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

  <h4>17th January 2025</h4>

  <br />

  <h2>What is long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
  <p>
    At this stage I'm not quite sure, I'm using this opportunity of studying at
    DevAcademy to open up my eyes to careers and a bit of insight on where I
    want to be in the future.
  </p>

  <br />
  <br />

  <h2>
    A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
  </h2>
  <p>
    I believe I have a strength in perseverance, even when it may get tough, I
    will keep looking for solutions to get to my end goal. A limitation I have
    ties back to my strength in a way, when something goes wrong I tend to stick
    at it until it's fixed. In a way this may seem good, I believe spending too
    long on one problem could keep me too narrow-minded.
  </p>

  <br />
  <br />

  <h2>
    What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in
    yourself while at Dev Academy?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The chance of furthering my skill of teamwork even further would go a long
    way for my future.
  </p>

  <br />
  <br />

  <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
  <p>
    I will keep myself to a strict schedule on work getting completed and making
    sure I keep my efforts up for not just week 1 but for the whole course. When
    things are starting to get to me, I know that this is a marathon not a
    sprint, so as long as I keep pushing, I'll get there.
  </p>

  <br />
  <br />

  <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
  <p>
    I know that there is always help out there and my facilitators are always
    more than happy to.
  </p>

  <br />
  <br />

  <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
  <p>
    Just keeping their positivity the whole way through, they already seem to be
    a bright spot in this course, so basically just stay being them.
  </p>

  <br />
  <br />

  <h2>
    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to
    other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school
    drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
  </h2>
  <p>
    The odd school drop offs and pick-ups for the nephew but besides this,
    everything else can be planned around the course.
