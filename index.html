    <h2>A bit about me:</h2>
    <p>
      Hey! My name’s Callum Bromley and I'm born and raised in Auckland, and
      beyond excited to start my journey of coding! Fresh out of college I was
      forced into University, quickly realising what I was studying wasn’t for
      me, took an extended gap year and decided to take off and was given an
      opportunity to work for a non-profit charity in Australia called
      Greenpeace. It was such a good stepping stone for me, being in a great
      office with people wanting to do good and having found some direction with
      what I wanted to do. One of my core values is gratitude. Always trying to
      recognise and appreciate the good in life, the kindness of others, and the
      opportunities that may come my way. I believe gratitude is essential in
      all aspects of life, as it fosters a deeper understanding of the world and
      everything happening around us. After my brother-in-law suggested
      DevAcademy, I made the decision to leave Greenpeace and spent the
      remainder of the year backpacking Southeast Asia. Which is an opportunity
      I would never take this opportunity for granted, as it led me to where I
      am now, beginning my journey here.
