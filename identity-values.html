<h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
<h4>9th January 2025</h4>
<br />

<h2>
  Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you
  weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and
  how you reflect on the decision now.
</h2>
<p>
  One ethical decision I make is a bit of a weird one. I work part-time at a
  nightclub and as you can imagine a lot of licenses and passports get left
  behind. Sometimes when I have spare time, I try to track down the owner (in a
  non-stalkerish way) and let them know we got it.
</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2>
  Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
  values and identity.
</h2>
<p>
  My family has been the biggest role-models to me, having a lot of siblings,
  with them being a bit older than me, has always pushed me and supported me in
  whatever i'm trying to do.
</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2>
  Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
  journey.
</h2>
<p>
  I believe I have a strength in perseverance, even when it may get tough, I
  will keep looking for solutions to get to my end goal.
</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
<p>
  I will keep myself to a strict schedule on work getting completed and making
  sure I keep my efforts up for not just week 1 but for the whole course. When
  things are starting to get to me, I know that this is a marathon not a sprint,
  so as long as I keep pushing, I'll get there.
</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2>
  Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
  How might these affect your learning journey?
</h2>
<p>
  A limitation I have ties back to my strength in a way, when something goes
  wrong I tend to stick at it until it's fixed. In a way this may seem good, I
  believe spending too long on one problem could keep me too narrow-minded.
  <br />
  I also did a DOPE 4 birds personality test and had 30% dove. With the
  description of my test reading, “people-oriented, loyal, friendly, hard
  working and a great team player but tends to avoid change, confrontation,
  risk-taking, and assertiveness.” Which is good to have some information on
  what I can rely on and what I need to work on.
</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2>
  Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but
  there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how
  effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would
  try now and why.
</h2>
<p>
  I played a lot of basketball growing up and being in many different teams.
  Quite often more than not, there would be quite a lot of tension in a way of
  what we were trying to do on the court. What we believed worked, was giving
  everyone's suggestion a go on the goal to see what the best solution would be.
