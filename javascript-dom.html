  <h2>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
  </h2>
  <p>
    Javascript, HTML and CSS is like a car. HTML is the frame and structure of the car. CSS is the paint job and interior design. With Javascript being the engine.

  <h2>
    Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).  </h2>
  <p>
    I believe I have a strength in perseverance, even when it may get tough, I
    will keep looking for solutions to get to my end goal. A limitation I have
    ties back to my strength in a way, when something goes wrong I tend to stick
    at it until it's fixed. In a way this may seem good, I believe spending too
    long on one problem could keep me too narrow-minded.

  <h2>
    Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).

  </h2>
  <p>
    A good example I found is using the example of making coffee.
    </p>
    <h3>Control Flow</h3>
    <p>Control flow is like following a step-by-step recipe. You make decisions at certain points to determine the next step.</p>
    <p>    Start: Decide if you want coffee. If yes, proceed. If no, end the process.
    </p>
    <p>    Choose Type: If you want espresso, use the espresso machine. If you want instant coffee, boil water and mix it.
    </p>
    <p>    Check Supplies: If you have coffee grounds, continue. If not, go buy some or stop.
    </p>
    <p>Each decision point determines the "flow" of the process.</p>
    
    <h3>Loops</h3>
<p>    Loops happen when you repeat actions until a condition is met.
</p>    
<p>For example, stirring sugar into your coffee:</p>
    <p>Add one teaspoon of sugar.</p>
    <p>Stir the coffee.</p>
    <p>Taste the coffee: If it’s sweet enough, stop. If not, go back to step 1.</p>
    
  </p>

  <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is like a map of your webpage. It gives you an opportunity to interact with the Javascript and manipulate it dynamically. You can interact with the DOM using JavaScript to dynamically change content, styles, and even add or remove elements.

  <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
  </h2>
  <p>
    Arrays and objects both store data but in different ways. Arrays are like ordered lists, where each item has a number (index starting from zero) , making them great for lists like names or numbers.

    Objects store data in pairs where each piece of information is associated with a unique label, called a key. You access the data by using these keys, making objects great for organizing related details, like storing a person’s name, age, and address under different keys.

  <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.
  </h2>
  <p>
    You can look at the function with a thinking of it being like a mini-program separated from the main program. This allows us to reduce a complicated program and separate it into smaller, more manageable chunks. Overall this reduces the complexity of the program.
