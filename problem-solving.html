  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

  <h4>6th February 2025</h4>

  <br />

  <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
<br>
<h2>were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>

  <p>
    In the first week or so, I was facing a bit of a problem where I was having trouble with pushing my work up to GitHub. Coders/Developers will use a software called GitHub to pull down and edit codes used by other developers and then will push up their completed codes. I got around this the way I'm sure every developer does, a whole lot of Google searches. At the time, I was feeling very discouraged about something so simple and so early in the course and I was struggling. However, I learnt that even in coding you can get tripped up in the smaller stuff and that Google is definitely the most helpful.

  <h2>elegantly solved a problem:
  </h2>
  <p>
    One that really stands out to me is when I was trying to add an image to my website that was stored on my computer. At the time I was doing ‘example.jpg’, instead of something like ‘/images/example.jpg. Using the /image, makes the computer know where to find the image stored in itself. The problem solving techniques I used are Google, and just taking a step back to just have a moment to realise how simple it really was. That bounces into what I learnt, something so simple can even stump you if you're so narrow-minded into your code, so it’s so important to just take a step back and listen every now and again.

  <h2>
   Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:
  </h2>
  <p>
    Pseudocode: 7/10
    Trying something: 8/10
    Rubber ducky method: 4/10
    Reading error messages: 8/10
    Console.logging: 7/10
    Googling: 10/10
    Asking your peers for help: 4/10
    Asking coaches for help: 5/10
    Improving your process with reflection: 7/10
    
  </p>

  <h2>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h2>
  <p>
    When I end up a bit behind, I feel a little reluctant to ask for help due to people being so far ahead of me. I am now starting to realise that there are different levels of experience with coding in this course, so I shouldn’t be worried about being behind others.
